Project Description:

Let's Understand How Insurance company works:

There are Mainly 3 things : 
1. Payer(Insurance Company)
2. Providers(Doctors,Physicians,Surgeons etc.)
3. Beneficiary (Patient who takes the insurance Policy)

Steps in Which they work:
1. Patient Enrolled himself in insurance policy according to his requirement.
2. An Insurance policy contains all the details Regarding the Services he will be receiving,what is the plan etc.
3. Suppose Member fell ill and he goes to Provider and Provider gave him services like lab tests,surgeries,x-rays etc.
4. After that member will go home and Than Provider Raise a claim which includes all the procedures and dianosis happened
   for that patient.
5. Payer will Receive that claim and they will cross-verify that particular provider,member are enrolled or not.
6. After confirmation they Reimburse the amount to the Provider.

How Frauds are Happening in raising Claims:
1. Raising Claims for the services which are not provided.
2. Duplicate submission of claims that are already happened.
3. Adding services in the claim which are actually not provided.
4. Giving services which are of higher cost when they are actually not required.


Primary Goal of this Project:
To create a model for the Insurance companies which can predict whether a particular claim can be fraudulent or not
Being proactive they will be able to handle these frauds and are able to prevent themselves from huge loss.
